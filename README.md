# Unity3D graph layout

This is a very veeery experimental code, my first ever approach to Unity3D and C#.
You can find a demonstration video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6PwTHlRGsA&t=7s

My goal was to try out to bring 3D graph analysis tool, something slightly similar to Skyrails (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2d312_dXEs)
